# shotest-path-app
Ù‘**Introduction**
This program will find the shortest path of the graph using heap.

**Files**
1. jscaller2.js: is the runner, so when want to run the program it will run on the browser.
2. 12.js: is the main program for the graph and have all graph's proprety coded.
3. pqHeap.js: a priorety queue using heap package.
4. linklist.js: linked list package.
5. queue.js: a normal priority queue package.
6. exercise9_2_1b.js: an example of graph containing nodes array, amd edges array which have the source node, target node, and the weith between them.

**How to use**
1. Install all codes in the repository(12.js, pqHeap.js, linklist.js, queue.js, and exercise9_2_1b.js).
2. Add a graph (with edges, nodes, and weights) as an array for each (edges, nodes, and weights) in a new program similar to (exercise9_2_1b.js) file.
3. Run the caller (jscoller2.html) by just open it using any browser.

**NOTE**
If you want to use another graph please just follow the same structure as the example above 
and make sure to open the jscaller2.js file using notepad or visual studio and add this line 
(<script type="text/javascript" src="your-Graph-Name.js"></script>) instead of 
(<script type="text/javascript" src="exercise9_2_1b.js"></script>).
